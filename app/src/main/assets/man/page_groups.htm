<h4>Calibration data groups</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>Group</u> button of the <i>Calibration data</i> window.<br><p>

Before computing the calibration coefficient the calibration data must be subdivided in groups of data having the same azimuth and inclination (different roll).<br><p>

The groups are identified by an integer number starting with 1.<br>
A data with number 0 is listed but excluded from the coefficient computation.<br>
"Deleted" data have group number -1.<br><p> 

You can assign the group number to each calibration data by hand (with the "Calibration data edit" dialog),
or let TopoDroid assign the group numbers for you.
There are three automatic grouping policies:
<ol>
<li>four data at a time for each group;</li>
<li>four-at-a-time for the first 16 data (four groups), then each data is a group by itself;</li>
<li>groups based on the relative angular distance (direction difference).</li>
</ol>
<br><p>

Actions:
<ul>
<li><b>Reset groups</b>: all the data groups are reset</li> 
<li><b>OK</b>: groups are assigned (only to data without a group)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
