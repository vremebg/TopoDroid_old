<h4>Location GPS</h4>

This dialog is opened tapping the <u>GPS</u> button of the <a href="page_fixed_list.htm">Locations</a> dialog.<br><p>
  
To use the GPS the Android Location must be enabled.
For security reasons a generic app, like TopoDroid, cannot enable the GPS.
If it is not enabled, TopoDroid shows a dialog asking whether you want do enable it (through the "Settings" app).
Remember to disable it when you are done, to save battery life.
<br><p>

This dialog has
<ul>
<li><b>station</b> name</li>
<li><b>comment</b></li>
<li><b>GPS</b> starts/stops the location</li>
<li><b>View</b> the point in a map app</li>
<li><b>Save</b> the point</li>
</ul>

While searching for satellites the "GPS" button becomes red (or green) displays the number of satellites in sight.
When enough satellites are in view the button becomes green and the coordinates are displayed underneath.
You should wait until the coordinate values are stable and the location error is small enough.
Then stop the GPS location tapping the button again.<br><p>
