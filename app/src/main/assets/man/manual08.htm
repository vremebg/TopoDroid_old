<h4>Export dialog</h4>
The export dialog has a selection-list of export-formats: <i>Compass</i>, <i>cSurvey</i>, <i>Survex</i>, <i>PocketTopo</i>, <i>Polygon</i>, <i>GHTopo</i>, <i>Grottolf</i>, <i>Therion</i>, <i>Topo</i>, <i>VisualTopo</i>, <i>Walls</i>, and <i>WinKarst</i>. Furthermore the data can be exported as DXF, and CSV text file. If the survey has a fixed station it can be exported as KML, and track file (PLT). This export fails if no the survey station is fixed. Finally you can export a ZIP archive which includes all the data of the survey.<br><p>

There are a number of export settings, that control the way TopoDroid writes the survey data in the various export formats.<br><p>

<h4>Rename dialog</h4>
With this dialog you can rename the survey. Renaming fails if there is already a survey with the specified name.<br><p>
The info in the database, the file of the notes, the binary sketch file, and the image and audio directory are renamed.
However reference to section "scrap" in the sketch files are not updated until the files are opened again.
Therefore it is advisable to go over and "open and close" all the sketches.<br><p>



<h4>Delete dialog</h4>
The delete dialog ask for confirmation to delete the survey. Deleting the survey is unrecoverable: the survey and all associated data (photos, notes, sketch files, etc. ) except the zip archive. Make sure to export a backup ZIP archive before you delete the survey.<br><p>
