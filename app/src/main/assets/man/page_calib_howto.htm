<h4>How to calibrate a DistoX</h4>

The DistoX needs to be calibrated before using. The calibration is a transformation of the data that accounts for
the non-perfect orthogonality of the axis of the sensors and alignment with the laser direction,
and effects of the electronics on the magnetic field.<br><p>

To compute the coefficients of this transformation, you must take a number of "accurate" shots
recording the raw readings of the sensors. This occurs when the DistoX is in "calibration mode".<br><p>

The calibration shots must be taken in a place free from magnetic influences, eg, in a cave or in a wood.
Beware of metal objects and electronic objects that might affect the DistoX.<br><p>

The shots must cover all directions and for each direction you must take a group of shots at different rotation about the laser axis.<br> 
The best way is to take 14 groups of four shots each, eight groups in the directions of the corners of a cube, and six in those of the centers of the faces. The four shots in each group should be taken rotating the DistoX by 90 degrees between one and the next. You can take more than 14 groups of shots; the more the better.<br>
At a minimum you must take four groups of four shots (with different roll) in four directions at 90 degrees in the horizontal plane, as if these directions were going from the center of a cube towards the center of four side-faces, and eight shots from the center of the cube to the eight vertices. Again, you can take more single shots.<br><p>

The calibration shots must be taken with care. Inaccurate shots will result in a bad calibration.
Therefore use fixed points (eg, a point in the wall, or on a tree) and far apart (a few meters) so that the accuracy of pointing the laser is better than the wanted calibration accuracy (2 cm at 5 m are about 0.2 degrees).<br><p>

After you have taken the calibration shots, download them with TopoDroid. You do not need to wait to take all the calibration
shots to download them: when you download some shots these are added to those already in the calibration. Therefore if, by mistake you take five shots instead of four, download the data and delete one of them in TopoDroid.<br><p>

Before computing the calibration you must tell TopoDroid how the calibration shots are grouped by the direction, i.e., you must assign a group to each shot. The groups are denoted with positive integers. A shot with group "0" (zero) or no group, is not used to compute the calibration. Deleted shots are usually not shown in the list.<br><p>

TopoDroid implements three policies to assign groups automatically:
<ul>
<li>"each group with four shots". This is the default policy and corresponds to the procedure described above.</li>
<li>"four groups of four shots, followed by single shots"</li>
<li>"shot group assignment based on the angular discrepancy between shots"</li>
</ul>
<br>
The group numbers can be assigned or changed by editing the calibration shots. Tap on a shot entry in the list to open the editing dialog.
<br>

After the groups of shots have been defined, you can compute the calibration.
Besides the calibration coefficients, the dialog shows the average error, its standard deviation, and the maximal error.
Furthermore there is a histogram with the distribution of errors for the calibration data. This plot has two vertical lines:
a yellow mark at 0.5 degrees and a red one at 1 degree.<br><p>

To summarize, to calibrate the DistoX you need to:
<ul>
<li>turn the DistoX in calibration mode</li>
<li>take the shots of the calibration data</li>
<li>download the shots to the app</li>
<li>assign the groups to the shots (automatically or manually)</li>
<li>compute the calibration coefficients</li>
<li>upload the coefficients to the DistoX</li>
<li>revert the DistoX to normal mode</li>
</ul>
