<h4>Active station</h4>

The active station is the station from which the survey will continue.
If you have set the active station, TopoDroid will continue numbering stations from it. If the active station is not set, the last one is used.<br><p>

Thus you can start a branch in the middle of the survey by selecting the station you want to attach as active station.
Alternatively, you can replace the from station of the first shot of the branch, afterwards.<br><p>

The active station is highlighted green in the shot data window. A long tap on another station switches the active station. A long tap on the active station turns it off.

The active station can be set in three ways
<ul>
<li>with a long tap on the station name in the shot data window.</li>
<li>from the <i>Saved stations</i> dialog (button "active")</li>
<li>through the <i>Station edit</i> dialog in the <i>Sketch</i> window.</li>
</ul>
