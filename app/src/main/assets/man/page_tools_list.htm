<h4>List and Grid tool picker</h4>

This dialog is used to select the current drawing tool.<br>
It is opened tapping the <u>Tool</u> button in the <i>Sketch</i> window (in "drawing" mode), provided the "tool picker" setting is set accordingly.<br><p>

The three tabs at the top, <b>Point, Line, Area</b> switch among the display of the three tool types, except for the "triple grid" layout, which displays all the types at the same time.<br><p>

The dialog displays the tools of the selected type,
<ul>
<li>either as a <b>list</b>, with a selection checkbox, tool icon and name</li>
<li>or a as a <b>grid</b> with the tool icons</li>
<li>or a as a <b>triple grid</b> (points, lines and areas) with the tool icons</li>
</ul>

To select a tool
<ul>
<li>check its box in the list, and close the dialog (Back key)</li>
<li>tap its icon in the grid, and close the dialog</li>
</ul>
<br>
A shortcut for these is a double-tap on the check-box or the icon.<br><p>


<b>Slider</b> set icon orientation (orientable point tools, and area tools).<br><p>

<b>+/-</b>: change icon size cycling through XS, S, M, L, XL.<br><p>

The <b>list</b> and <b>grid</b> picker have also the most recently used tools at the top, to the right of the <b>+/-</b> button.
A tap on one of these tools selects it.<br><p>
