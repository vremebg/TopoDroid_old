<b>Sketch exports</b><br>

Sketches are stored in TopoDroid binary format, and can be exported as
<ul>
<li>Therion th2 file</li>
<li>cSurvey file</li>
<li>2D DXF</li>
<li>SVG</li>
<li>PNG image file</li>
</ul><br><p>


In addition to the <b>Therion</b> export, there
is an option to automatically save a sketch in Therion format whenever it is closed.<br><p>

The <b>cSurvey</b> export file contains both the plan and the profile sketches. However it does not has the x-sections. X-sections cannot be exported as cSurvey files, and you need to export as images if you want to use them for postprocessing with cSurvey.<br><p>

The resolution of <b>PNG</b> images is an adjustable setting. However a larger and more detailed image requires more CPU time and may fail due to memory limits. If it fails TopoDroid tries reducing the resolution until it succeeds exporting the sketch as PNG image file.<br><p>

Sketches can be exported as 2D <b>DXF</b> files. The AutoCAD version of the exported DXF files is R12. The DXF export has been tested with VariCAD 2016-1-07 and BricsCAD 3.1.17. It is not guaranteed that can be opened by AutoCAD.<br><p>
