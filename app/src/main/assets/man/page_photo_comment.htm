<b>TopoDroid camera</b><br>
This is a simple implementation of a camera. 
Its unique feature is that it stores the azimuth and inclination of the device in exif tags in the image file. 
The azimuth is stored as GPS_LONGITUDE and the inclination as GPS_LATITUDE (with sign).
<br>
The date/time is also stored in the exif tags.
<br><p>

The camera has three buttons on the lower right.<br>
<ul>
<li><b>camera</b>. Red: ready, tap to take a picture. Blue: on hold, tap to turn camera active.</li>
<li><b>save</b> saves the picture</li>
<li><b>back</b> closes the window</li>
</ul>
