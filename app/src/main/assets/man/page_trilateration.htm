<h4>Trilateration</h4>

Trilateration is a spacial "loop compensation" applied to triangles.
It can be used in short surveys in disuniform magnetic environment
as the azimuths are computed by measuring the sides of triangles, relying on the fact that
the angles of a triangle are determined by its sides.
The values measured by the DistoX are used for the inclinations.
<br><p>

Trilateration is enabled by setting the "Loop compensation" to "Triangles".<br><p>

The survey should be made of a net (or a ladder) of triangles. Therefore you measure 0-1, 1-2, and 0-2;
then 2-3 and 1-3, and so on.<br><p>

The trilateration algorithm carries out a global estimate for the angle azimuths, and is rather slow.
Therefore it is advisable not to use it for large surveys.
