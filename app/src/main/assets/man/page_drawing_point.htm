<h4>Sketch point</h4>

This dialog is opened when you select a point symbol and tap the
<u>Item</u> button in the <i>Sketch</i> window (in "edit" mode).<br><p>

Point properties:
<ul>
<li><b>size</b>: one of XS, S, M, L, XL</li>
<li><b>orientation</b>, if the point is orientable</li>
<li><b>text</b>, if the point has text associated</li>
<li>additional Therion <b>options</b></li>
<li><b>x-section</b> checkbox to display the xsection outline ("section" points only)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>


<b>Save</b> confirms the changes and closes the dialog.<br><p>

"Section" points have also the <b>Sketch</b> button to open the sketch, if it exists.
Changes to the xsections are not propagated to the outline in the sketch: to update it,
close the outline and open it again.
<br><p>

When "side-drag" is enabled, the point orientation can be changed also by sliding up and down on the left and right sides of the canvas.<br><p>

The <u>Back</u> key closes the dialog without saving the changes.<br><p>
