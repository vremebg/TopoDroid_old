<h4>Sketch Reload</h4>

This dialog is opened by the <u>Reload</u> menu of the <i>Sketch</i> window.<br><p>

TopoDroid maintains backup copies of sketch files, from which the sketch can be recovered.<br>
TopoDroid keeps a set of four backup copies for each sketch file.
These are named with suffixes "bck", "bck0", "bck1", and "bck2" and are stored in the 
<i>tdr</i> subdirectory (binary sketch files). Whenever a sketch is saved the backup copies are rotated
(eg, "bck1" is renamed "bck2", and so on; "bck" is renamed "bck0"),
the old "tdr" file is renamed with suffix "bck", and the sketch is saved to a new "tdr" file.
<br><p>

TopoDroid saves a sketch whenever it is modified (eg, a new item is added, or part of the sketch is erased)
while it is open. Only one backup is used in this case: the old saved copy being renamed with suffix "bck".
<br><p>

When you switch between plan and profile view, or to and from a cross-section,
and when you close the sketch window, the open view is saved.
<br><p>

The dialog shows the list of the sketch backups with
<ul>
<li>how long ago it was written, with suffixes for minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), months (M) and years (Y)</li>
<li>size of the file, in square brackets, in bytes</li>
<li>filename</li>
</ul>
<br><p> 

To recover a sketch you choose which copy to load, and tap the <u>OK</u> button to confirm.<br>
The <u>Back</u> key closes the dialog without reloading the sketch.
