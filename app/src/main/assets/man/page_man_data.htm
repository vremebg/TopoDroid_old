<h4>Manual data input</h4>

If you do not have a DistoX you can still enter the shot data manually. 
Tapping the <u>Add</u> button opens the dialog for the shot data input. 
You must enter the station names and the shot data (length, azimuth, and clino).
The "reverse" button allow to swap the stations, ie, reverse the shot.<br><p>

If only the backward fields are filled in (the forward fields are left empty)
the shot is entered with the backward data.<br><p>

To add a splay shot enter "." (period) or "-" (dash) in the TO station.
LRUD can be added to a splay shot, thus providing additional splay shots.
In this case the LRUD refer to the FROM station.<br><p>

The <u>Save</u> button at the bottom inserts the shot into the survey, and updates the station names incrementing them so that the dialog is ready to input the next shot. The <u>OK</u> button inserts the shot in the survey, and closes
the dialog.<br><p>

<b>Using Android for the direction</b><br>
Azimuth and clino can be set using the Android sensors:<br>

A timer (10 s by default) lets you point the device before measuring.<br>
<img src="btn_photo.png" valign="bottom"> by the normal to the display: 
look at the TO station on the screen and start the timer when the station is in the
middle of the cross-hair.<br><p>

<b>LRUD</b><br>
If LRUD are specified the respective splay shots are also inserted.
Additionally you can select whether these refer to the FROM station (default) or to the TO station.<br><p>

If the shot clino is smaller than the v-threshold setting, the LRUD are in a vertical plane:
U is upwards, D downwards, L horizontal to the left of the shot (i.e., with azimuth that of the shot minus 90 degrees),
and R horizontal to the right of the shot.<br><p>

If the shot clino is greater than the v-threshold setting, the LRUD are in a horizontal plane:
L is west, R is east, U is north, and D is south.<br><p>

<b>Units</b><br>
Data must be entered in the current units.
For example if the length units are "feet", distances must be entered in "feet".<br><p>
