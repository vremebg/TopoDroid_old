<h4>Sketch shift and flip</h4>

<b>Sketch shift</b> [E]<br>
The drawing can be shifted as a whole by selecting the "Fix ref" checkbox in the sketch reference dialog. Then in "move/zoom" mode the drawing can be shifted by dragging it with two fingers.<br><p>


<b>Profile sketch flip</b> [E]<br>
When viewing the profile, a long tap on the "Plan/Profile" button opens a confirmation dialog to flip the profile sketch horizontally.
<br>
The dialog has a checkbox to reverse the extend direction of the shots as well.
This is enabled by default.
Only the shots that are displayed in the profile, are reversed, ie, their "extend" is changed.
Therefore shot hidden behind a station are not affected.
By this means you can reverse only a portion of the survey data.
<br>
Shots can also be reversed with a multiple selection in the surey shot window.
